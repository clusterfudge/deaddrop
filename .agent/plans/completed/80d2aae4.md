# Plan: tasks

**ID:** 80d2aae4
**Created:** 2026-01-21 03:18:08 UTC
**Updated:** 2026-01-21 03:35:00 UTC
**Status:** abandoned
**Session:** 308968c3-3947-4b0c-87ef-b1fb834d2086

## Context

Need to design a task/todo feature for deadrop, and clarify the schema migration approach before implementation

## Clarification Questions

- [x] **What schema migration approach should we use for deadrop?**
  - Options: Simple: Add migration SQL in init_db() that runs ALTER TABLE IF NOT EXISTS style checks, Versioned: Track schema version in DB and apply incremental migrations, Alembic: Use proper migration tool (adds dependency), Manual: Document migrations, run manually on deploy
  - **Answer:** Versioned: Track schema version in DB and apply incremental migrations

- [x] **What should the 'tasks' feature do? Please describe the use case.**
  - **Answer:** sorry, I wanted you to use your planning tools to come up with an implementation plan, as opposed to yoloing from memory.

- [x] **Who can create/assign tasks?**
  - Options: Any identity can create tasks for any other identity in the namespace, Only namespace owner can create/assign tasks, Tasks are self-assigned only (like personal todos), Combination: anyone can create, but assignment rules vary
  - **Answer:** this is not a feature of deaddrop, it's a suite of tools in silica.

- [x] **How should tasks relate to messages?**
  - Options: Tasks are separate from messages (new table, new endpoints), Tasks are a type of message (with special content_type or flag), Tasks can be attached to messages (reference a message), Other (please describe)
  - **Answer:** N/A
