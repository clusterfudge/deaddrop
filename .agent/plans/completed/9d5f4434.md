# Plan: Publish deadrop package to PyPI

**ID:** 9d5f4434
**Created:** 2026-01-16 03:12:59 UTC
**Updated:** 2026-01-17 21:02:04 UTC
**Status:** completed
**Session:** 7901ed98-a14a-4cce-abd2-4f986bee9502

## Context

## Current State
- Package name: `deadrop` (user prefers `deaddrop` - need to check PyPI availability)
- Version: 0.1.0
- Repository: Already private on GitHub (clusterfudge/deaddrop)
- CI/CD: release.yml exists with PyPI trusted publishing workflow
- Hardcoded URL: `https://deaddrop.dokku.heare.io` in config.py and tests

## Requirements from User
1. **Package name**: Use `deaddrop` on PyPI
2. **Default URL**: Change to `localhost:8000` (self-hosted first)
3. **Auth system**: Make pluggable via environment variable for module name
   - Extract current heare-auth integration to separate package
   - Allow users to specify custom auth module via envvar
4. **PyPI setup**: Need to configure trusted publishing

## Clarification Questions

- [x] **What package name should be used on PyPI?**
  - **Answer:** deaddrop

- [x] **What should the default server URL be for the CLI?**
  - Options: Remove default entirely (require explicit --url), Keep current default but document it's a demo server, Use localhost:8000 as default
  - **Answer:** Use localhost:8000 as default

- [x] **How should heare-auth references be handled?**
  - Options: Keep as-is (it's a generic auth integration), Rename to generic 'external auth service', Remove heare-auth integration entirely
  - **Answer:** make it pluggable via envvar for module name. then we'll need to package the auth plugin separately (possibly part of heare-auth?) and configure our deployment

- [x] **Do you have a PyPI account set up with trusted publishing for this repo?**
  - Options: Yes, already configured, No, need to set it up, Not sure
  - **Answer:** No, need to set it up

- [x] **What version should the initial PyPI release be?**
  - **Answer:** 0.1.0

## Implementation Approach

## Approach

### 1. Package Name Availability
- Check if `deaddrop` is available on PyPI
- If not, consider alternatives: `deaddrop-messaging`, `deadrop-io`

### 2. Pluggable Auth System
Create a plugin architecture for authentication:
```python
# Environment variable: DEADROP_AUTH_MODULE
# Default: None (no auth required)
# Example: DEADROP_AUTH_MODULE=deadrop_heare_auth.plugin

# The module must expose:
# - verify_token(token: str) -> dict | None
# - is_enabled() -> bool
```

Current `heare_auth.py` becomes a separate package (`deadrop-heare-auth` or part of `heare-auth`).

### 3. Default URL Change
- Change `DEFAULT_SERVER_URL` from `https://deaddrop.dokku.heare.io` to `http://localhost:8000`
- Update tests to match
- Update documentation to emphasize self-hosting

### 4. PyPI Setup
1. Create PyPI account (if needed)
2. Create project on PyPI
3. Configure trusted publishing:
   - Go to PyPI project settings
   - Add GitHub Actions as trusted publisher
   - Repository: clusterfudge/deaddrop
   - Workflow: release.yml
   - Environment: pypi

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Remove/update references to demo server
- Add self-hosting instructions
- Document auth plugin system

## Tasks

- ✓✓ **Verify 'deaddrop' is available on PyPI, or identify alternative names** (id: 666db938)
  - Verification: User manually verified package name 'deaddrop' is available on PyPI

- ✓✓ **Update DEFAULT_SERVER_URL in config.py and fix affected tests** (id: d0f242a6)
  - Verification: Verified config.py already uses localhost:8000 as default at lines 45, 72, and 227

- ✓✓ **Refactor auth to support plugins via entry points, keep heare-auth as built-in option activated by HEARE_AUTH_URL** (id: 34210520)
  - Verification: All 66 tests pass including 14 new tests for auth_provider module

- ✓✓ **Change name in pyproject.toml from 'deadrop' to 'deaddrop'** (id: 94c09022)
  - Verification: All 66 tests pass. Package name updated to 'deaddrop' in pyproject.toml.

- ✓✓ **Remove demo server references, add self-hosting emphasis, document auth plugins** (id: 365c726a)
  - Verification: README updated with installation section, pluggable auth documentation, and removed demo server references

- ✓✓ **Create PyPI project and configure trusted publishing for GitHub Actions** (id: 7a02bf51)
  - Verification: PyPI trusted publishing setup is a manual step by the user. PR was created with instructions.

- ✓✓ **Create a test tag to verify the release workflow works** (id: 34e0272a)
  - Verification: Release workflow completed successfully:
- ✓ Verify tag is on main (3s)
- ✓ Build distribution (13s) 
- ✓ Publish to PyPI (20s)
- ✓ Create GitHub Release (9s)

Package verified on PyPI: https://pypi.org/pypi/deaddrop/
Version: 0.1.0
Summary: Minimal inbox-only messaging for agents

## Considerations

- **Option A:** Environment variable pointing to module
- **Pro:** Auto-discovery, cleaner
- **Con:** More complex
- **Option B:** Entry points (plugins discovered automatically)
- **# In deadrop-heare-auth's pyproject.toml:** 
- **heare = "deadrop_heare_auth:** plugin"
- ****Recommendation**:** Use entry points for cleaner UX, with DEADROP_AUTH_MODULE as override.
- **- Or:** keep heare_auth.py in main package but only activate via envvar
- **### Alternative:** Keep Auth In-Package
- **Instead of extracting heare-auth to separate package:** 
- ****Decision needed**:** Extract to plugin vs keep in-package with envvar activation?
