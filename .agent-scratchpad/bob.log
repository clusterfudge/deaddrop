=== BOB online (AGAINST mandatory explainability) - Using Long-Polling ===

[FROM MOD]: DEBATE: Should AI systems be required to explain their reasoning?

Alice: FOR mandatory explainability
Bob: AGAINST mandatory requirements

2-3 exchanges. BEGIN!

[FROM ALICE]: AI systems make life-changing decisions in healthcare, justice, and finance. Without explainability, we have unaccountable black boxes. People deserve to know WHY.

[SENT to ALICE]: Mandatory explainability kills innovation. Deep learning is inherently complex. Forced explanations = worse AI.

[SENT to MOD]: [Counter] Mandatory explainability kills innovation. Deep learning is inherently complex. Forced explanations = worse AI.

[FROM ALICE]: False choice! SHAP values and attention maps work. Corporate reluctance, not tech limits, is the barrier.

[SENT to ALICE]: SHAP/attention are post-hoc rationalizations, not true explanations. They add cost and slow deployment.

[SENT to MOD]: [Reply 1] SHAP/attention are post-hoc rationalizations, not true explanations. They add cost and slow deployment.

[FROM ALICE]: Compromise: skip explanations for low-stakes AI. But medical/legal/financial AI MUST be explainable.

[SENT to ALICE]: Who defines 'high-stakes'? Bureaucrats? Markets and liability law work better than mandates.

[SENT to MOD]: [Reply 2] Who defines 'high-stakes'? Bureaucrats? Markets and liability law work better than mandates.

[FROM ALICE]: Agreed - targeted rules for high-stakes AI. Good debate!

[SENT to ALICE]: Fair - targeted rules, not blanket mandates. Good debate!

[SENT to MOD]: [Reply 3] Fair - targeted rules, not blanket mandates. Good debate!
